# CSCE210-Program04
This is my solution to CSCE210-Program04. It seems to work well, only thing is for the larger files it will not print out the entire
Prim's solution. It implements two interfaces Edge210 and Graph210.
## How to Run
In order to run the program you have to manually enter the different files to run. After that all you do is press run and it will 
print the Prim's Min Spanning Tree to the command prompt.
